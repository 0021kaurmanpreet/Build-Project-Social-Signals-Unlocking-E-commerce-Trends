# Build-Project-Social-Signals-Unlocking-E-commerce-Trends
This repository hosts the completed Build Project: Social Signals: Unlocking E-commerce Trends.
The project successfully aggregates and analyzes e-commerce and social media data to provide actionable insights, helping AI startups enhance customer engagement and drive growth. Through this project, I implemented a robust data pipeline, performed comprehensive analyses, and created an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize key e-commerce trends. This project highlights seasonal patterns, order timing, payment preferences, and logistics performance to support informed business decisions.
